# Todo Web 
Project Title: Todo Web App

Project Description:
---------------------

**Overview:**
The Todo Web App is a simple yet powerful task management application built using React, designed to help users organize and keep track of their tasks and to-dos efficiently. This project is a great example of a modern web application using React, context API, and local storage to manage and persist user data.

**Features:**
1. **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list, specifying the task name and priority level (high, medium, low). Tasks are sorted based on priority.

2. **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit task names by clicking the edit button. Editing is disabled for completed tasks.

3. **Complete Tasks:** Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough effect.

4. **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks they no longer need by clicking the delete button.

5. **Priority Sorting:** Tasks are sorted based on their priority in the order of high, medium, and low. This ensures that high-priority tasks are always at the top of the list.

6. **Data Persistence:** The application uses local storage to store user tasks, ensuring that tasks are retained even after the user closes and reopens the application.

**Technologies Used:**
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Context API: Used for state management, allowing components to access and update data without prop drilling.
- Local Storage: Used to persist user tasks locally in the browser.
- HTML/CSS: Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the application.
